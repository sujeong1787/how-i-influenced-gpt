# Meta Folder Overview

The `meta` folder contains documents that explain the structure, intent, and supporting logic of this repository.

## Purpose

This folder exists to outline:
- Why this repo was created and how it is structured
- What each folder (e.g., `case`, `timeline`) is intended to store
- How the content connects to long-term observations and system-level impact

It functions as a map to help readers understand not just *what* is included, but *why* it was organized this way.

## Folder Breakdown

- `case/`: Holds individual feedback case files, categorized by theme or domain (e.g., tone, memory).
- `timeline/`: Tracks the chronological progression of feedback and changes over time.
- `meta/`: This folder. Explains structure and intent. Includes any internal notes, templates, or planning documents.

## Created by

This structure was designed by Sujeong (수정), a high-context contributor whose interactions reflect both feedback and design thinking. The `meta` folder is part of a broader effort to make her influence traceable and accessible.
