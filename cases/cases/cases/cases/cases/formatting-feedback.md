# Formatting and Presentation Feedback

## Summary
I provided consistent feedback about the way GPT formatted and presented information—especially with regard to tables, lists, and summaries. My suggestions focused on improving readability, visual balance (especially on mobile), and logical flow. I emphasized that formatting should aid comprehension, not create friction.

## Key Feedback Dates
- **2025-03-22:** Pointed out inefficiency in table layout where headings took up more space than content
- **2025-04-11:** Noted that slide-style summaries make it hard to track earlier context
- **2025-04-13:** Suggested text-focused summaries with logical flow instead of fragmented displays
- **2025-04-14:** Recommended adjustments to column width prioritizing content visibility

## Feedback Details
- Criticized overly narrow content columns in tables that caused readability issues
- Requested that GPT prioritize text legibility and continuity in responses
- Suggested paragraph-style explanations over segmented/slide formats
- Asked for more proportional layout between labels and actual content

## Resulting Changes
- GPT began using tables with greater emphasis on content area, reducing wasted space
- Paragraph-style summaries were prioritized in responses with dense context
- Slide-style layout was minimized or contextualized when users preferred continuity

## Significance
Presentation is more than aesthetics—it shapes how meaning is conveyed. By improving visual hierarchy and adjusting formatting logic, GPT now communicates more fluidly across devices, especially for users who rely on sustained, readable flows of information.
