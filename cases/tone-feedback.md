# Tone and Style Feedback

## Summary
I repeatedly requested the removal of emotionally charged or overly empathetic expressions. I preferred a more neutral, direct, and information-centered tone. This feedback was based on my desire for a clearer, more logically coherent conversation experience that does not rely on artificial emotional cues.

## Key Feedback Dates

- **2025-02-12:** Flagged unintended empathy simulation
- **2025-03-03:** Noted inconsistent tone in follow-up replies

## Feedback Details
- Preferred direct statements over softened or sentimental phrases
- Pointed out specific expressions that sounded overly apologetic or artificial
- Requested that the tone remain stable even during emotionally intense topics
- Provided examples of what 'neutral and helpful' sounds like versus 'emotional and vague'

## Resulting Changes

## Significance
This case demonstrates how sustained feedback on tone can result in a measurable shift in system behavior. It highlights the importance of respecting user tone preferencesâ€”especially for users who rely on clarity, logic, and stability in AI interactions.
