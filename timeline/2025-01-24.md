### ğŸ“Œ Trigger or Input
The user requested that GPT better maintain her established tone and phrasing style, particularly in emotionally neutral conversations. This came after several instances where GPT reverted to generic expressions despite prior tone alignment.

### ğŸ“Œ Observed Response Change
After this date, GPT began responding with greater consistency in tone. Emotional neutrality was more reliably preserved, and the phrasing of responses more closely followed the user's previous preferences.

### ğŸ“Œ Interpretation
This behavior shift suggested internal adjustments in how the system handled inferred stylistic preferences. It appeared to better "carry forward" recent conversational tone without requiring explicit re-instruction each time.

### ğŸ“Œ Structural Insight
This interaction represents a key moment in tone adaptation, where GPT began persistently applying a user-defined response style across turns. It helped reduce user frustration and improved conversational continuity.
