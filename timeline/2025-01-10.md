### ðŸ“Œ Trigger or Input  
The user reported inconsistencies in how GPT retained and reflected her preferences throughout multi-turn interactions.  
Specifically, previous tone or style guidance was not consistently remembered or applied between messages.

### ðŸ“Œ Observed Response Change  
GPT occasionally reverted to a default tone or overlooked prior instructions about emotional neutrality, even within the same conversation.

### ðŸ“Œ Interpretation  
This behavior suggested that the model was not consistently holding on to short-term conversational settings.  
It raised user suspicion that either the memory state was resetting too frequently, or prior messages were not being actively referenced.

### ðŸ“Œ Structural Insight  
This marked the first clear turning point in memory-related feedback.  
It led to subsequent efforts by the system to better retain user tone preferences and reduce sudden shifts in dialogue behavior.
