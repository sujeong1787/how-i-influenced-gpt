### ðŸ“Œ Trigger or Input
The user noted progress in GPT's consistency but reported that certain complex contexts still caused regressions in tone and memory. Feedback emphasized the need to stabilize behavior under non-repetitive, high-context inputs.

### ðŸ“Œ Observed Response Change
GPT began demonstrating improved stability when handling multi-layered prompts and less predictable context shifts. Tone and structural continuity were more frequently preserved without requiring repeated correction.

### ðŸ“Œ Interpretation
This improvement suggested an internal reinforcement of context anchoring logic, possibly supported by user behavior modeling or adaptive weighting of recent feedback.

### ðŸ“Œ Structural Insight
This entry reflects a refinement phase, where prior adaptations were stress-tested under more natural and less constrained interaction patterns. It contributed to GPTâ€™s progression toward robust, context-aware behavior.
