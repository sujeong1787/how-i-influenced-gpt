# ðŸ“‚ Timeline Folder Overview

The `timeline` folder documents a chronological sequence of key feedback moments and behavioral changes observed in GPT's responses.

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose

- Track when significant feedback was provided  
- Show how GPT responses evolved over time  
- Map conversational patterns to system-level shifts  

Each file (e.g., `2025-01-10.md`) contains:
- The date of observation or feedback
- A brief summary of what changed
- Link to the relevant detailed case in the `/case` folder

This folder functions as a **logbook**, tracing the *cause and effect* behind each adaptive response.
