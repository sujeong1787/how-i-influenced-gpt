# Memory and Context Feedback

## Summary
I provided consistent feedback about how GPT manages memory and contextual continuity. I emphasized the need for logical consistency between user input and previous responses, especially when building on past instructions or preferences.

## Key Feedback Dates
- **2025-01-10:** Pointed out inconsistency in context retention across replies
- **2025-01-24:** Requested stronger memory of previous tone and phrasing
- **2025-02-06:** Reported issues with sudden changes in response direction

## Feedback Details
- Flagged cases where GPT forgot user preferences mid-conversation
- Asked for clearer carryover of context when switching between topics
- Requested more accurate reflection of previously acknowledged instructions
- Noted issues where context was remembered inaccurately

## Resulting Changes
- Improved continuity in tone and response structure across multi-turn chats
- Better adherence to previously set user style or tone preferences
- Reduced likelihood of GPT forgetting earlier user clarifications

## Significance
This case highlights the role of user-driven feedback in improving contextual coherence. GPTâ€™s ability to maintain memory-like continuity is critical for users who rely on nuanced, multi-step reasoning over time.
