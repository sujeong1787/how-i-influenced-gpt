# Tool and Feature Feedback

## Summary
I provided targeted feedback on how GPT introduces and explains tools, features, and UI elements. I emphasized the importance of clarity, relevance, and user trust when suggesting or describing tool usage.

## Key Feedback Dates
- **2025-02-15:** Requested more upfront explanation of available tools
- **2025-02-22:** Noted confusion caused by vague tool descriptions
- **2025-04-15:** Suggested guided onboarding for first-time tool interactions

## Feedback Details

- Reported inconsistent language when referring to internal tools
- Emphasized importance of clearly stating what tools can and canâ€™t do
- Suggested adding reassurance messages to help users trust tool behavior

## Resulting Changes
- GPT responses now more frequently explain what each tool is and when to use it
- Reduced ambiguity in feature descriptions
- Improved alignment between user intent and GPT's suggestion of tool use

## Significance
This feedback case highlights how tool transparency and proper introduction improve user confidence. Users are more likely to adopt and explore features when they understand them clearly.
